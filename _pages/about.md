Hello! I am in my final year as a dual-title Ph.D. candidate in Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Penn State. My interest is in political violence including terrorism, civil war, interstate conflict, and hate crime. My dissertation explores cooperation and rivalry between terrorist groups and how these relationships and the network structure affect organizational lethality and longevity. 

My research uses a variety of quantitative methods, including network analysis, natural language processing, and survival analysis. I am also skilled with deep learning with PyTorch. I received my M.A. in Political Science from Penn State in 2021 with a focus on international relations and political methodology. Before coming to Penn State, I received a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Kansas.
