Hello! I recently defended my doctoral dissertation in Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Penn State. My substantive research interest is in political violence including terrorism and hate crimes. My dissertation explores cooperation and rivalry between terrorist groups and how these relationships and the network structure affect organizational lethality and longevity. For this project, I collected original yearly network data on cooperation and rivalry between militant groups in Lebanon.

My methodological interests include network analysis, survival analysis, natural language processing, and time-series cross-section methods. I also have experience with deep learning with PyTorch. I received my M.A. in Political Science from Penn State in 2021 with a focus on international relations and political methodology. Before coming to Penn State, I received a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Kansas.
